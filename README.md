## Game Play

You are a doctor in a weird world where lava and waterfalls exist together in close proximity. There has been an outbreak of a virus, your task is to make sure you kill the enemy or you get killed by the enemy. Your survival is a must here.


### Objective

This game has 1 object - Kill as much virus as possible. Initially, there will be a few infections but as you get more proficient in killing Suriva, more will come!

Try to get to the highest wave possible and remember that there is a limited supply of special Mushrooms!

Don't forget to post your score to the global leaderboard.
